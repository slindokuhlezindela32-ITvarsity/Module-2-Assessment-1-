                    <h3>AMPHITHEATRE</h3>
                       <p> An amphitheatre is an open-air venue used for entertainment, performances, and sports. The term derives from the ancient Greek ἀμφιθέατρον amphitheatron, from ἀμφί (amphi), meaning "on both sides" or "around"and θέατρον théātron, meaning "place for viewing".</p>
                       
                       <p>Ancient Roman amphitheatres were oval or circular in plan, with seating tiers that surrounded the central performance area, like a modern open-air stadium. In contrast both ancient Greek and ancient Roman theatres were built in a semicircle, with tiered seating rising on one side of the performance area. In modern usage, an "amphitheatre" may consist of theatre-style stages with spectator seating on only one side, theatres in the round, and stadia. Natural formations of similar shape are sometimes known as natural amphitheatres.</p>

                       <p>The earliest permanent extant amphitheatre is one at Pompeii , in which the arena is sunk below the natural level of the surrounding ground. It is built of stone,  and seated approximately 20,000 spectators. The amphitheatre at Pompeii, Italy</p>
